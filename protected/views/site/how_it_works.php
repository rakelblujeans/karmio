Bloomspot merchants are the businesses that those members will love. Engaging photos, informative editorial, and a built-in discount get members into our partners' doors; once there, they'll be likelier to indulge on little extras. And if they have a great time, they'll come back again and again. </p>                       <br/>                    <p>  The result is a symbiotic pairing of client and merchant. In short, a match made by Bloomspot. </p>                                     </div>                                      </div>						</div>                        <div class="bg-bottom" ></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
