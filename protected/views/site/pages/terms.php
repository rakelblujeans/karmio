<p><strong>6. Creating an Account on our Site</strong></p>

  <p>Your account is non-transferrable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any other person. If you violate any of these limitations we may terminate your account and, without limitation, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any unredeemed vouchers in your account. If we terminate your account, you may not re-enroll or join under a new account unless we formally invite you. If you commit fraud or falsify information in connection with your use of the Site or in connection with your Karm.io account, your account will be terminated immediately and we reserve the right to hold you liable for any and all damages that we suffer, to pursue legal action through relevant local and national law enforcement authorities and to notify your Internet Service Provider of any fraudulent activity we associate with you or your use of the Site.</p>

  <p><strong>7. Terms of Sale</strong></p>

  <p>Vouchers you purchase through our Site as a Karm.io account holder are promotional offers that you purchase from participating Merchants through our service. The vouchers are redeemable for certain goods, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the voucher. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the voucher. The Merchant is the issuer of the voucher and is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (&quot;Liabilities&quot;) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a voucher or not. </p>

  

  <p>You waive and release Karm.io and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a voucher or the services/goods it provides in connection with it.</p>

  <p>By purchasing any voucher you agree to the terms of this Agreement and these Terms of Sale. By purchasing, viewing a mobile version, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any voucher, you agree to these Terms of Sale specifically (&quot;rules&quot;) the terms on the voucher itself and any additional, deal specific terms advertising the voucher at the time of purchase (collectively, the &quot;fine print&quot; regardless of how labeled). These rules apply to all promotional vouchers that we make available, unless a particular voucher's fine print states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these rules and a voucher's fine print, the voucher's fine print will control.</p>

  <p>Karm.io is a service provider for the Merchant identified on the voucher and the Merchant is the sole issuer of the voucher. Vouchers have two separate values: (a) the &quot;amount paid&quot; and (b) the promotional value. The &quot;promotional value&quot; is the additional value beyond the amount paid. Together, the amount paid and the promotional value equals the &quot;full offer value&quot; of the voucher. For example, if you pay $20 for a voucher that gets you $50 of goods or services from a Merchant, the full offer value is $50, the amount paid is $20 (this amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the voucher unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law).  Each voucher will also specify that a certain amount that will be donated to a designated charity (the &quot;Donated Amount&quot;).  The &quot;Net Merchant Amount&quot; is the amount paid minus the Donated Amount.</p>

  <p>If a Merchant refuses to honor any voucher, Karm.io will refund the Net Merchant Amount upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the Karm.io account of the purchaser with the Net Merchant Amount for future purchases on the Site.  You can contact us regarding refunds at refunds@karm.io. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash, unless required by law. Unauthorized or unlawful reproduction, resale, modification or trade of vouchers is prohibited.</p>

  <p>The promotional value of a traditional Karm.io voucher will EXPIRE on the date specified on the face of the voucher, unless prohibited by law. The amount paid WILL NEVER EXPIRE. The promotional value of a traditional Karm.io voucher may not be combined with other offers and no portion of its value is intended to cover tax or gratuity. Traditional Karm.io vouchers are not reloadable and are fully transferrable.</p>

  <p><strong>8. Modification of this Agreement</strong></p>

  <p>We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of this Agreement as we deem necessary or desirable. If we make changes that materially affect your use of the Site or our services we will notify you by sending you an email to the email address that is registered with your account and/or by posting notice of the change on the Site. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon the earlier of our dispatch of an email notice to you or our posting of notice of the changes on our Site, provided that, these changes will not apply to vouchers purchased prior to the effective date of such changes. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site and for all vouchers purchased after the effective date of the change. We suggest that you revisit our Terms of Use from time to time to ensure that you stay informed of any such notifications of changes to the Site. Your use of the Site after we update these Terms of Use will constitute acceptance of the modified Terms of Use.</p>

  <p>We also reserve the right to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of our services or the Site including, but not limited to, requirements for access or use.</p>
