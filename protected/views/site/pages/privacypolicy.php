We may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.

<p>We may also disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may provide our merchants, business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users.</p>

<p><strong>5. Cookies and Related Technologies</strong></p>

  <p>When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.</p>

<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>

<p>For example, when you visit our Sites, Karm.io and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Sites.</p>

<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. &quot;Session&quot; cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. &quot;Persistent&quot; cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g., the cities for which you want to be shown vouchers).</p>

<p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.</p>

<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.</p>

<p><strong>6. Your Choices</strong></p>

  <p>We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and the kinds of deals you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to Karm.io, and you can limit the communications that Karm.io sends to you.</p>

<p>You can manage your email preferences by logging into your account through the Sites, entering the &quot;My Account&quot; section, and selecting &quot;Manage Email Subscriptions.&quot; You can also manage your subscriptions by following subscription management instructions contained in the commercial messages that we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others. You may update your subscription preferences from time to time. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from promotional email messages, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your purchases. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our promotional email messages, we will still send you confirmations when you purchase vouchers.</p>

<p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. </p>

<p>You may manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share Location Information with Karm.io, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>

<p>You may also manage the sharing of certain Personal Information with us when you connect with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect. Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media website or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between Karm.io and your social media account or your mobile device.</p>

<p>If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from Karm.io merchants or business partners, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you.</p>

<p><strong>7. Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</strong></p>

  <p>Keeping Personal Information about you current helps ensure that we offer you the best deals available through our merchants and business partners. You can do several things to help keep Personal Information about you current. You can access, update and delete your Contact Information, Financial Account Information, and the other information you provided to use in your profile by logging into your account and accessing the &quot;My Account&quot; section of the Site or sending us an email at privacy@Karm.io.</p>

<p>If you want to close your account or have other questions or requests, please contact us. While we are ready to assist you in managing your subscriptions, closing your account, and removing your active profile, we cannot always delete records of past interactions and transactions. For example, we are required to retain records relating to previous purchases on the Sites for financial reporting and compliance reasons.</p>

<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us here. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p><strong>8. Security of Personal Information</strong></p>

  <p>Karm.io has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal Information. For example, we use industry-standard encryption technology to secure Financial Account Information when it is being transmitted over the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>9. Privacy Practices of Third Parties</strong></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Karm.io through your interaction with the Sites. Other websites that may be accessible through links from our Sites may have their own privacy policies and personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Our merchants and business partners may have their own privacy policies, too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies provided by these other parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion.</p>

<p><strong>10. Facebook Connect</strong></p>

  <p>Karm.io offers Facebook users the opportunity to interact with friends and to share on Facebook using Facebook Connect. If you are logged into both Karm.io and Facebook, when you use the Site's Facebook connection functions, we will link your Facebook account with your Karm.io account if the email addresses match. If the email addresses do not match, we ask you if you want to link them and you must validate that you control the accounts. If you are already logged into Karm.io but not logged into Facebook, when you use the Site's Facebook connection functions, you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to sign up for Facebook. By proceeding through any of these scenarios, you grant Karm.io permission to access your Facebook profile information and to use it in accordance with the Facebook terms of use and this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you are not currently registered as a Karm.io user and you use the Site's Facebook connection functions, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join Karm.io. Once you register with Karm.io and connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent Karm.io activity back to your Facebook wall. Please refer to the privacy settings in your Facebook account to manage the performance of your Facebook account.</p>

<p><strong>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

  <p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different privacy practices, such as when we add new features to our Sites. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of notice on the Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information about our privacy practices.</p>
