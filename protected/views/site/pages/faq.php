<p>
<a name="q1" class="qred">What do I need to create an account?</a><br />
All you need is an email address to sign up with Karm.io. 
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="q2" class="qred">What information does Karm.io store about me?</a><br />
Only the email address associated with your account. We don't store any payment information or your password. 
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>
<p>
<a name="q3" class="qred">How does Karm.io handle my personal information?</a><br />
We do not share any of your personal information with our partners or nonprofits. So even though you've made a charitable donation, you won't end up on any mailing lists. </p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q4" class="qred">What if I lose/forget my password?</a><br />
Karm.io does not store any passwords, so we can't send you a reminder. But resetting your password is easy.  Just visit the Karm.io site, click forgot my password and you'll get an email with instructions on how to create a new password.  
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q5" class="qred">Do I have to connect my account to a social network?</a><br />
No, but you can if you'd like. We've created the Karm.io platform so that it easily integrates with Facebook. And don't worry, we'll never post anything on your behalf without your permission. 
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q6" class="qred">How do I pay for a deal?</a><br />
All purchases must be made with a credit or debit card, and are processed through a secure server.  
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q7" class="qred">Do deals expire?</a><br />
Yes. Each deal has an expiration date, chosen by the merchant. These expiration dates are printed clearly on both the website and the coupon.
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q8" class="qred">What happens if my deal expires?</a><br />
Unfortunately, Karm.io cannot provide refunds for deals past their expiration date, unless the merchant has gone out of business during the course of the deal.   
</p>
<a href="#top" class="qrtop">Back to Top</a>

<p>
<a name="q9" class="qred">What if a vendor runs out of the product or service I purchased? </a><br />
Karm.io works with each merchant to ensure that all deals can be honored during the promotional time period, so you don't have to worry about a deal being oversold.
