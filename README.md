karmio
======

Karmio is a groupon-like site with a charity component. For each deal purchased, the business contributes a portion towards a charity they've chosen, or they can let the charity be buyer's choice. I came onto the project late in an attempt to save a poorly designed project. The site had been in development for over 2 years and had yet to launch. Their code was cobbled together over the years by various off-shore programmers and as a result was in a god awful state. As the only tech resource, there was no one I could rely on for backup. With minimal experience in PHP, I geared up on the PHP Yii Framework within one month and proceeded to revamp the codebase in two. I pulled duplicated code into common modules, removed hardcoded constants, added unit tests, added source control, and fixed numerous critical bugs.
